    Here I will slowly add notes while teaching that I hope are of some use to the students. <br>
    Notes are taken from the material of their assigned textbook to maintain consistency, but <br>
    I will introduce my own metaphors and informal thoughts on the physics. This is in hopes the <br>
    material is seen in multiple ways and more importantly, is played with to encourage creative <br>
    thought around physics instead of rigid procedures already exhausted by the course and books.
