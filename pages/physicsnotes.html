    <p>
      Here I will keep both physics notes and notes on physics. I have been working on a large body of notes covering everything I currently know (or don't know) about physics. 
      Some of these notes are playful in nature and may take the form of comics, and some of the notes may lean more academic and be designed as an informal discussion of the 
      subject matter. I also include on this page my notes on physics, because sometimes I just gotta say something about the culture of physics, the way physics is taught, or
      the miscillaneous thoughts on the general topic that may or may not be worth the time to read. The degree of detail may also vary, but you can be sure to find my metaphors and cartoonish physical descriptions throughout!
