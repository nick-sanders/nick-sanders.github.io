    <p>
      I am currently a first year masters student at the University of Iceland looking for resesarch projects. My supervisor is Dr. Jesus Zavala in astrophysics, who has
      been extremely helpful in my adjustment to living in Iceland and thinking of my career. The astrophysics department have been friendly and supportive and I'm thankful
      to have great people around in a new environment. As I look for projects I keep in mind that I am interested in chaos, climate, MHD simulations, and taking cookies
      from every jar!

      Although I currently live in Rekjavik, I come from the valley of California where the Sun always shines, rain never falls, and fires never die. I have a wonderful 
      friend in a 13 year old Aussie named Mousse who has been with me through many of the hardships in life. In my off time I love to bake, ferment things, paint, grow 
      plants, and try new hobbies...like randomly trying to build a table! I'm a bookworm at heart with a passion for literature and love to surround myself with 
      dusty spines. I sometimes say things on <a href="https://twitter.com/astronicholas">Twitter</a> and am passionate about science communication and outreach, so say hi!
