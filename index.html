    <p>
      I am currently a first year masters student at the University of Iceland studying theoretical physics. My supervisor is Dr. Jesus Zavala in astrophysics, who has
      been extremely helpful in my adjustment to living in Iceland and thinking of my career. The astrophysics department have been friendly and supportive and I'm thankful
      to have great people around in a new environment. My focus is currently a little broad involving interdiscipinary interests in physics research. I love to assist in teaching
      courses covering physics and calculus. Working with students is one of the joys of being a graduate student!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before moving to Iceland, I started studying physics at California State University Sacramento in my mid 20s. I came to physics by way of pop-sci books I read by chance and 
      found a passion and inspiring people. The mentors at Sacramento State offered their support and guidance in my personal life as well as professional. Their patience 
      and devotion to cultivating young physicists is among the best examples of mentorship I have seen! I also made some wonderful friends there who continue to impress 
      and inspire me! I became a Cal-Bridge Scholar and got the chance to work on projects in biophysics and astrophysics that encouraged me to take the lead. 
      I've had a nonlinear trajectory in life and learned I can trust myself to be honest and resilient, moving in the direction of things I find interesting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Although I currently live in Rekjavik, I come from the valley of California where the Sun always shines, rain never falls, and fires never die. I have a wonderful 
      friend in a 13 year old Aussie named Mousse who has been with me through everything. In my off time I love to bake, ferment things, paint, grow 
      plants, and try new hobbies...like randomly building a table! I'm a bookworm at heart with a passion for literature and love to surround myself with 
      dusty spines. I sometimes say things on <a href="https://twitter.com/astronicholas">Twitter</a> and am passionate about science communication and outreach, so say hi!

    <h2> Projects </h2>
    
    <h3> Ice Dynamics </h3>
    <p>
      This summer I will work with the wonderful Dr. Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir to simulate the changing mass balance of Icelandic glaciers 
      using PISM code! By applying a hydrodynamic correction to existing climate models, a better approximation can be obtained of the melting rate.
      I´m excited to learn more about the cryosphere! (2022)
    </p>
    
    <h3> Luminosity of Gamma Ray Bursts </h3>
    <p>
          The number of short Gamma-ray Bursts as a function of their jet luminosity is determined at the jet-launching site, not as the jets propagate. 
      This internal effect has caused a significant reduction in their number as the luminosity gets higher. A collaboration with my amazing advisor, Dr. Barniol Duran,
      at California State University Sacramento for my <a href="CSUS_Senior_Project_Physics_Final.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a>. (2021)
